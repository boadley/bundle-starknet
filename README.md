## üéØ The Vision

For the growing class of Nigerian crypto-earners, Bundle is the financial super-app that acts as a universal router, allowing them to instantly spend their digital assets on any real-world service, from airtime to bank transfers, without ever touching a traditional off-ramp.

## üî• The Problem We Solve

Nigeria has one of the world's most vibrant crypto economies. Yet, using this digital value for daily life is slow, expensive, and complex. The bridge between Web3 earnings and real-world expenses is broken. Bundle fixes this.

## ‚ú® How It Works: The "OpenRouter" Magic

Bundle is a non-custodial web app built on Starknet. Our backend acts as an intelligent routing engine:
1.  **User Pays in Crypto:** A user initiates a payment for a N10,000 bank transfer using USDC.
2.  **Starknet Confirms:** We confirm the transaction in 2-3 seconds on the Starknet network.
3.  **Router Executes in Fiat:** Our backend instantly makes a N10,000 Naira payment to the recipient from our corporate account via the Paystack API.
4.  **The Result:** The recipient gets Naira instantly. They have no idea crypto was involved. It's fast, secure, and regulator-friendly.
